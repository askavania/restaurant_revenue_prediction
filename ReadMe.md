# **Restaurant Revenue Prediction**

## **Project Overview**

With thousands of quick-service restaurants (QSRs) across multiple continents, **Our client 'A'** is a leading company operating some of the most popular restaurant brands worldwide. Employing over 20,000 people across Europe and Asia, **'A'** makes significant investments each year in new restaurant site developments. Its current portfolio includes a variety of restaurant brands catering to different tastes and culinary preferences.

Today, deciding when and where to open new restaurant locations is often a subjective decision, driven by the judgment and experience of development teams. However, this subjective approach introduces challenges when scaling decision-making across various geographies and cultures.

Each new restaurant site requires a considerable investment of time and capital to launch. Selecting a suboptimal location often leads to closures within the first 18 months, resulting in operational losses. Developing a robust mathematical model to forecast restaurant revenue would enable **'A'** to increase investment in key business areas, such as innovation, employee training, and sustainability efforts, by optimizing the process of selecting new restaurant sites.

The goal of this project is to use a combination of demographic, real estate, and commercial data to predict the annual sales of 100,000 regional locations accurately, providing the **'A'** team with data-driven insights to improve the strategic placement of new sites.

## **Project Objective**

To develop a data-driven, predictive model to forecast the annual revenue of potential restaurant locations using a combination of demographic, real estate, and commercial data. The model will serve as a critical tool in identifying locations with the highest revenue potential, allowing the company to make more effective, cost-efficient site selection decisions.

## **Data Description**

### **Dataset Structure**
- **Training Data**: Contains demographic, real estate, and commercial data for various restaurant sites. The target variable, `revenue`, represents the annual sales for each location.
- **Testing Data**: Comprises similar feature information without the `revenue` column, on which predictions will be made.
- **Obfuscated Features**: Variables `P1` through `P37` are anonymized features that contain crucial information about location demographics, real estate specifics, and commercial attributes.

### **Key Variables**
1. **Target Variable**: 
   - `revenue` (continuous): The annual revenue generated by each restaurant location.
   
2. **Feature Categories**:
   - **Demographic**: Derived from the obfuscated `P1`-`P37` features, representing population, age and gender distribution, and development scales.
   - **Real Estate**: Includes attributes such as area, frontage, and parking availability.
   - **Commercial**: Presence of surrounding businesses, competitors, and points of interest, encapsulated in some of the obfuscated variables.
   - **Geographical & Temporal**: Variables such as `City Group`, `Type` of location, and `Restaurant Age` derived from `Open Date`.

## **Project Approach**

### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed categorical and continuous variables to identify key trends and significant predictors.
   - Checked for skewness in the data and applied transformations as necessary.
   - Visualized outliers, particularly in the `revenue` column, to explore their impact on model performance.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
   - **Derived Features**: Created `Restaurant Age` as a feature by calculating the years since the opening date.
   - **Transformation**: Log transformations were applied to `P1`-`P37` features to address skewness.
   - **Encoding**: One-hot encoding for categorical features like `City Group` and `Type` to handle potential variations in test data.

### **3. Modeling Strategy**
   - **Baseline Model**: Created a benchmark using linear regression to establish initial expectations for model performance.
   - **Advanced Modeling with PyCaret**: Leveraged PyCaret’s regression suite to automate model selection, tuning, and evaluation, prioritizing RMSE as the key evaluation metric.
   - **Polynomial Features**: Generated polynomial features to capture complex interactions among obfuscated variables, enhancing the model's predictive power.
   - **Outlier Handling**: Outliers in `revenue` were reviewed and adjusted selectively, to retain valuable data points while reducing noise.

### **4. Model Selection and Tuning**
   - PyCaret’s `compare_models` function was used to shortlist and select the best model based on RMSE.
   - Further tuning was performed on the top models to optimize hyperparameters and enhance predictive accuracy.
   - **Feature Importance Analysis**: Analyzed feature importance of the selected models to understand which factors most significantly influence restaurant revenue.

## **Key Findings**

1. **Feature Importance**:
   - The most influential features included interactions between demographic and commercial variables. Specifically, features `P3 x P25` and `P26 x P33` had a significant impact on the target variable, accounting for over 14% of the feature importance collectively.
   - The `Restaurant Age` feature showed a positive correlation with revenue, suggesting that more established restaurants tend to perform better.
   - The `City Group` variable highlighted revenue differences between city types, indicating that location type plays a critical role in restaurant performance.

2. **Model Performance**:
   - The baseline model achieved an RMSE of 4,440,097, setting an initial benchmark.
   - After tuning, the final model (AdaBoost Regressor) achieved an RMSE of 3,288,196 on validation data, a substantial improvement over the baseline.
   - Cross-validation metrics showed consistent performance, indicating model reliability across different data subsets.

3. **Insights for Site Selection**:
   - Locations with certain demographic characteristics, such as a high presence of specific commercial attributes and favorable real estate metrics, are more likely to generate higher revenues.
   - By identifying these top features, **'A'** can prioritize locations that align with high-performing feature profiles.

## **Conclusion**

This project successfully developed a robust predictive model that significantly improves the accuracy of revenue forecasts for new restaurant sites. By utilizing demographic, real estate, and commercial data, the model provides **'A'** with a data-driven approach to optimize site selection. 

This model not only minimizes the financial risk associated with poor location choices but also supports strategic growth by ensuring investments are directed toward high-potential sites. With a carefully designed pipeline, the model can be retrained and updated with new data, allowing **'A'** to keep its revenue predictions accurate as business dynamics evolve. The insights derived from feature importance further aid the decision-making process, ensuring that the company remains competitive and resource-efficient in an increasingly data-driven market.
